    <h2>NAZARETH'S HISTORY</h2>
    <h3>Ancient History</h3>
    Prehistoric Era: Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around
    Nazareth was inhabited as far back as the Bronze Age. <br />
    <br />
    Biblical Times: Nazareth is most famously known as the childhood home of
    Jesus Christ, and it is mentioned in the New Testament. <br />
    The angel Gabriel is said to have announced to Mary that she would bear
    Jesus here (Luke 1:26-38). <br />
    <br />
    Roman Period: During this time, Nazareth was a small Jewish village. The
    population was likely quite small, around 400 people. <br />
    <br />

    Possible Ancient Origins: There's evidence of settlements in the Nazareth
    area dating back to the Bronze Age (around 3300-1200 BCE)! <br />
    While we can't be sure of a continuous presence, it hints at a long history
    for the location. <br />
