      <h2>ABOUT NAZARETH</h2>
      <p>
        Nazareth is a city in Israel with biblical history. In the old city, the
        domed Basilica of the Annunciation is, some believe, <br />
        where the angel Gabriel told Mary she would bear a child. <br />
        St. Joseph’s Church is said to be the site of Joseph’s carpentry
        workshop. <br />
        The underground Synagogue Church is reputedly where Jesus studied and
        prayed. <br />
        Nazareth Village, an open-air museum, reconstructs daily life in Jesus’
        era. <br />
        Nazareth, historic city of Lower Galilee, in northern Israel;<br />
        it is the largest Arab city of the country. <br />
        In the New Testament Nazareth is associated with Jesus as his boyhood
        home,<br />
        and in its synagogue he preached the sermon that led to his rejection by
        his fellow townsmen. <br />
 Nazareth's location in Galilee placed it right in the middle of power struggles between different empires and kingdoms throughout history. <br>
 Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders – they all fought for control of the region, and Nazareth likely changed hands numerous times. <br>
  This would have made for a very dynamic and sometimes turbulent history for the town. <br>
